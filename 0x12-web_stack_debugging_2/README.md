# 0x12. Web stack debugging #2

In this project i have managed to change a user from `root`(super user) to another user.

## [Task-0](./0-iamsomeoneelse) (Run software as another user)

- runs the command `whoami` under the user passed as an argument
  usage: `./0-iamsomeoneelse <user_name>`

## [Task-1](./1-run_nginx_as_nginx) (Run Nginx as Nginx)

- changes the user from `root` to user `nginx`

## [Task-2](./100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less) (7 lines or less)

- changes the user from `root` to user `nginx`
- same as task-1 but using less code
